## Hello Riko

### Prepare for github pages
To prepare the build output of the NextJS static site, we need to copy it over to docs folder in the root 
[Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#about-publishing-sources).
Once the site is exported `npm run build` then the output form the `src/pages/out` directory need to be moved over to `docs` directory
